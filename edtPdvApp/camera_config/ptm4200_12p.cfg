CL_DATA_PATH_NORM:             1b

# htaps/vtaps: if dual channel flag is ON (see CL_DATA_PATH_NORM) we need to
# set either htaps or vtaps to 2. Which one depends on whether the two pixels
# that come out with each clock are both on the same line (uncomment
# htaps: 2) or on adjacent lines (uncomment vtaps: 2) 
#
htaps:	2

# interlace method
# only for interleaved and some dual channel cameras
# determines how image is deinterleaved for display -- BYTE_INTLV is only
# one of many available methods -- see *_INTLV in pdv_dependent.h and
# camera configuration guide for more

#method_interlace:	BYTE_INTLV

# send serial commands (camera dependent) to camera to get it into expected mode

#	DUL=0	# Dual tap
#	TAH=1	# Active High Trigger. Should we do this here?  Might have issues if user switches cfg files

# this camera wants CC2 to be high or open
# NOTE: Can't confirm requirement for CC2 high
# Manual indicates trigger over camlink should be CC1 of 1..4
# which would indicate MODE_CNTL_NORM: 00
# mode control register bits:
# 0-3: mode control lines 0-3 held high or low
# 4-7: which of control lines 0-3 to use as trigger
# (usually 0 [none] or 1)
