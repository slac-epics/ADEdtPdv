# Initialize camera:
# This camera uses GenCP protocol, a binary protocol
# By setting serial_trigger to GenCP, we enable wrapper functions which translate
# simple serial commands to the proper GenCP packets including checksums and packet IDs.
#
# Examples:
# Write 1 to 32 bit unsigned int at register 0x130F4
# U32 0x130F4=1
#
# This gives us simple access to low level camera registers.
# Accessing the camera via the features defined in it's feature XML file
# requires use of the genicam software api.
#
# Some key register addresses, lengths, and names:
# Address		Length	Name
# 0x00000000	U32		GenCP Version
# 0x00000004	C64		64 character Manufacturer Name
# 0x00000044	C64		64 character Model Name
# 0x000001D0	U64		Manifest table address (XML feature files)
# 0x000001E0	U64		Device Configuration: Bit 0=HeartbeatEnable, Bit1=MultiEventEnable
# 0x000001E8	U32		Heartbeat Timeout in ms
# 0x00000204	U32		AccessPrivilege, 0=Avail (no image streaming), 1=Exclusive
# NOTE: Must set AccessPrivilege in BRM to 1 for write access and read or write at
# least once every 3 sec so heartbeat won't timeout and stop image streaming!
#
# Address		Length	Name
# 0x000130F4	U32		RegAcquisitionStart, 0=Stop, 1=Start
# 0x00013108	U32		RegAcquisitionMode, 1=Continuous, 2=Single, 3=Multiple
# 0x00013108	U32		RegAcquisitionFrameCount, used for Multiple AcquisitionMode
